# 8086sim
A 8086 CPU Simulator written in C#/.NET using the WPF Framework

It was mainly written due to a homework assignment for the Computer Enhance Course (https://www.computerenhance.com)

Due to lack of time, only a handful of instructions are actually implemented.
The main purpose is learning how 8086 (X86 predecessor) works, how the instructions are decoded and how to execute them.

The application itself visualizes the internal states, but has no real output - except for the live-updating memory window.
